**Richard Ball** asked the (rhetorical) question "Is it feasible to include reproducible research methods in **undergraduate** training?"  [@ballYesWeCan2023], answering that question with **"Yes we can!"**. 

---

I will go beyond that, and argue **"Yes we should!"**

# Why?


## There is a lot of opportunity

- As of September 2024, the LDI Replication Lab has verified **around 2500** distinct AEA journal manuscripts as to their computational reproducibility. [@10.1257/pandp.114.878]

## This is being done right now ...

- Since 2014 (starting before the official AEA work), **more than 200 undergraduates** have been trained, and have helped in the assessment.

## ... but not in the classroom (mostly)

- The training is **not part of a regular** (Cornell) **curriculum**.

# What is a replication package?

# Student involvement

## What do the students do?

- Analyze **data provenance** as described by authors
- Verify **ability to computationally reproduce** results
- **Attempt reproduction** as per instructions (README)
- Inevitably **debug**
- Write a **shareable report**


## How are the students trained?

::: {.multicolumn}
:::: {.col}


- Intense 1-day training on principles and technology
- Loose follow-up on three examples
- Then **real** cases.

## What are students trained on?

- Versioning: All **reproducibility checks** are versioned (git crucial)
- **Running code** (R, Stata, Python, Julia, Matlab, SAS, ...) 
- Running code **reproducibly** 

## Data Acumen

- What is **data provenance**?
- How to **obtain data** 
- Importance of knowing your **rights and obligations** (licenses, etc.)
- How to convey how you obtained the data, and where

## Communication

- Debugging: There is always some ... and reproducibly debugging is important (**internal communication**)
- Writing reports: **external communication** to authors, conveying what was done, and what may have gone wrong (constructive and objective criticism)

## Organization

- Organizing their work within the Lab
- Structuring reports and other documents

## Technical reasons

- Use of specific workflow management system
- Use of Windows computers!
- other tools


# Is this useful?

## Students think so

## *2020 sociology graduate working for a nonprofit research organization*

> "[I received] overwhelmingly positive feedback on my documentation method in code reviews, which is all thanks to my time with LDI"


## *2021 Economics graduate, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Political Economics*

> "... I feel like [LDI Replicator position] was the single most important thing ... to prepare myself to succeed in [predoctoral fellowship]...."


## *2024 Economics intern*

>  For every issue I did solve, there was a gratifying moment, knowing I’ve explored something new and that the authors would read and heed my documented solution. It’s always a huge confidence boost whenever I take the initiative to research and dabble with problems I might not be able to solve.

# Summer 2024 internship at AEA

## Participants

- Initiated by Cornell University (Vilhuber)
- 5 partner institutions (**Wellesley, Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Notre Dame, U Colorado at Boulder**, UNC Chapel Hill$^*$), each with a local coordinator
- 9 students selected in total 

## Timeline

- Training in April (to skirt finals)
- Start after finals (May 20 - June 1, depending)
- 12 weeks core participation

## Structure

- **12-16 weeks** of participation
- Funded by journal for real work (real articles, real reports)
- Partially supported by various host institutions 

## Student contributions

- Part of regular team (others were continuing Cornell students)
- **12-16 "cases"** (~ 1/week)
- A small number of revisions (same article, improved replication package)

## Student learning

- Successful debugging (with assistance when needed)
- Structured internal reporting (how to convey what you did that did not work)
- Writing reports

## Student learning (technical)

- Use of remote Windows and in some cases Linux servers
- Basic use of multiple software not previously used
- Repeated use of modern software development tools: Git, Markdown, automation 

# Student experiences and reproducibility services {auto-animate=true transition="fade"}

## Student experiences and reproducibility services  {auto-animate=true transition="none"}

- **Journals** are organizationally distinct from universities (mostly)

## Student experiences and reproducibility services {auto-animate=true transition="none"}

- Most **curricula** currently do not include the methods and tools necessary for reproducible work 

## Student experiences and reproducibility services {auto-animate=true transition="none"}

- Most research institutions to not provide **reproducibility services** to their researchers

## Timing of publication

- In the context of the AEA journals, students provided feedback **prior** to (first) publication
- [World Bank](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/), some research institutes are providing service to their staff / members with public artifacts (**early institute-level** publication)[^institutes]
- **[i4R](https://i4replication.org/)** is providing more in-depth feedback **post-publication**

# A note on **graduate education**


## A note on graduate education

- Many graduate seminars have elements of this... yet **not nearly enough**!
- This morning and tomorrow: at ROCKWOOL Foundation/ Humboldt Universität! (thanks to Alexandra Spitz-Oener for putting together)
- Also Cornell ECON 7850

## Ideal graduate curriculum 

::: {.incremental}

- [**Day 1 reproducibility**](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/day1-tutorial/)
- Useful tools: Why you should learn (and love) the **command line**
- Writing articles that **combine text and code** (and when not to do this)
- **High-performance computing** and why you should care about it
- Reproducibility, transparency, and **data ethics**: How and when to share data, and when not to

## Ideal graduate curriculum {auto-animate=true transition="none"}

::: {.incremental}

- [Reproducibility when **data are confidential**](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/reproducibility-confidential/)
- Creating an **archive**, and why that's a good thing [^archive]
- [**Verifying** reproducibility](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/presentation/)
- Writing a **grant proposal**
- Writing a **referee report**

# **Yes we should**

## **Yes we should**

::: {.incremental}

- Include training on reproducible practices in **undergraduate curricula** (junior / penultimate year) [^alsomendez]
- Include training on reproducible practices in **graduate curricula** (after coursework) 
- Training should include practice on **pre-publication** (own faculty) and **post-publication** (journal publications)
- May involve structured reporting (**[Social Science Reproduction Platform](https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/)**)
